# Type Ahead

This is the sixth project of the Javascript30 challenge.

This JavaScript mini-project, "Type Ahead ðŸ‘€," demonstrates dynamic search functionality for cities and states. Utilizing the Fetch API, it fetches data asynchronously and filters search results in real-time based on user input, enhancing the user experience with interactive search suggestions.


## Concepts utilised in creating this project-

1) Fetch API:

Retrieves data asynchronously from a provided URL.

2) Promises:

Handles asynchronous operations and their results.

3) Arrow Functions:

Shorter syntax for defining functions, often used for inline function expressions.

4) Regular Expressions (RegExp):

Patterns used for matching character combinations in strings, enabling powerful text searching and manipulation.

5) Event Listeners:

Attach event handlers to elements, responding to specific user actions like changing input values or pressing keys.
